# into to arguments

## My solve 
**Flag:** 'pwn.college{Msc9inDMeUH7T1M-skSR1nVDV6h.QX4YjM1wiNyEzNzEzW}'

This challenge says to type a line of text and hit enter,
the shell actually parses your input into a command and its arguments.
The first word is the command, and the subsequent words are arguments.
I have done this because the challenge had directly asked me to 
'''bash
$ hello hackers
hackers
pwn.college{Msc9inDMeUH7T1M-skSR1nVDV6h.QX4YjM1wiNyEzNzEzW}
