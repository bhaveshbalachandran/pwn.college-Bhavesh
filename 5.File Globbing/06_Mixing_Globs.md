## Challenge 6: mixing_globs

The challenge is about combining the glob techniques youâ€™ve learned to produce a single short glob (6 characters or less) that matches multiple differently-named files. The target files are challenging, educational, and pwning, and you must pass one globbed argument to /challenge/run that expands to those filenames.

## My Solve
**Flag:**'pwn.college{Mhzct8Kb_Js1Dprqf1at-Kvnwf2.QX1IDO0wiNyEzNzEzW}'

```
hacker@globbing~mixing-globs:~$ cd /challenge/files
hacker@globbing~mixing-globs:/challenge/files$ /challenge/run [cep]*
You got it! Here is your flag!
pwn.college{Mhzct8Kb_Js1Dprqf1at-Kvnwf2.QX1IDO0wiNyEzNzEzW}
```
