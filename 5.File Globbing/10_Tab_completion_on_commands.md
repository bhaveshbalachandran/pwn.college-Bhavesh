## Challenge 10: tab_completion_on_commands

The challenge demonstrates that tab completion works for commands as well as filenames. A command beginning with pwncollege is available in the environment; typing its prefix and pressing <Tab> will complete the command name so you can run it and get the flag.

## My Solve
**Flag:**'pwn.college{Io9STT32uNUN8VtVwxYohgzJZTr.0VN0EzNxwiNyEzNzEzW}'

```
hacker@globbing~tab-completion-on-commands:~$ pwncollege-19054 
Correct! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{Io9STT32uNUN8VtVwxYohgzJZTr.0VN0EzNxwiNyEzNzEzW}
```

## What I Learned

Tab can be used to autocomplete commands
Completion prevents typing errors and is faster than remembering full command names.
