# Challenge 2 : Pondering_Paths
The challenge is about executing a program located in the /challenge directory using its absolute path.

##My solve
**Flag:** pwn.college{kiVA5cYSfkKK_yWSZwm4WFpT-35.QX1QTN0wiNyEzNzEzW}


As instructed in the challenge, I invoked the program by inputting the absolute path of the run binary,
 which is in the /challenge directory:
```

hacker@paths~pondering-paths:~$ /challenge/run
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{kiVA5cYSfkKK_yWSZwm4WFpT-35.QX1QTN0wiNyEzNzEzW}

## What I Learned
This challenge taught me How to run programs using absolute paths
The difference between relative and absolute paths (./run vs /challenge/run).
The location of challenge binaries in pwn.college (/challenge directory) and how the root directory / works.
