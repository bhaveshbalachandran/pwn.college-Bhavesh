# Challenge 1 : The_Root

The challenge is about the root directory and invoking programs present in it 

## My solve 
**Flag:** 'pwn.college{4HZqUhBRKGu0bXazh0teBcKCZfd.QX4cTO0wiNyEzNzEzW}'

As instructed in the challenge, I invoked the program by inputting the absolute path of 'pwn' by starting with a '/'
```
[hacker@paths~the-root: ~$ / pwn
luck!
BOOM! !!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{4HZqUhBRKGu0bXazh0teBcKCZfd.QX4cT00wiNyEzNzEzW}
```

## What I Learned
