# Intro to commands

## My solve
**Flag:** 'pwn.college{cinwTt0x1qBDHc4aFEIrysBcgNu.QX3YjM1wiNyEZNZEZW}'
The challenge says “invoke the hello command to get the flag.” 
the direct approach is to run the named command.
I confirmed I had a working shell (whoami)
then executed hello exactly as spelled
Once the command printed text matched the patten and Irecognized and copied it as the flag.
I saved output
```bash
$ hello
pwn.college{cinwTt0x1qBDHc4aFEIrysBcgNu.QX3YjM1wiNyEZNZEZW}
