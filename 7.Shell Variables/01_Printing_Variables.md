## Challenge 1: printing_variables

The challenge is about printing shell variables. The flag for this level is stored in an environment variable named FLAG; your job is simply to print that variable from the shell.


## My Solve 
**Flag:**'pwn.college{AQnjfV6BHgzmzqXH-hRL6gzXR4F.QX3UTN0wiNyEzNzEzW}'

```
hacker@variables~printing-variables:~$ echo $FLAG
pwn.college{AQnjfV6BHgzmzqXH-hRL6gzXR4F.QX3UTN0wiNyEzNzEzW}
```
