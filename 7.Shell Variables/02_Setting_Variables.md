## Challenge 2: setting_variables

This challenge practices assigning shell variables. You must set the variable PWN to the exact value COLLEGE (case sensitive) and demonstrate reading it back.


## My Solve 
**Flag:**'pwn.college{grEjB-RTKIUCAp3-NiSy18nC9z9.QX5UTN0wiNyEzNzEzW}'


```
hacker@variables~setting-variables:~$ PWN=COLLEGE
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:

```
