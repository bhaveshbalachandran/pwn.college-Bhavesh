## Challenge 3: multi-word_variables

The challenge is about assigning multi-word values to shell variables â€” you must learn to quote values so that spaces in the value are treated as part of the value, not as argument separators.


## My Solve 
**Flag:**'pwn.college{IyAkt2dJCpm7MzRG5KySC-Ptvww.QXwYTN0wiNyEzNzEzW}'

```
hacker@variables~multi-word-variables:~$ PWN="COLLEGE YEAH"
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{IyAkt2dJCpm7MzRG5KySC-Ptvww.QXwYTN0wiNyEzNzEzW}

```

## What I Learned
